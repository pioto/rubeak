Work properly w/ DualView/Xinerama
  This requires changes to XOSD, I think...

Allow configuring options and actions w/o modifying the source code.
  Maybe use some yaml voodoo?

Proper error handling in lots of places (right now we just die sloppily in lots
of cases).

Add a Makefile or some such thing for making installing easier.

Test cases?
